Introducing the TDS Meter:
                   
                   A TDS meter measures the number of total dissolved solids like salts, minerals, and metals in the water. 
                   As the number of dissolved solids in the water increases, the conductivity of the water increases, 
                   and that allow us to calculate the total dissolved solids in ppm (mg/L).

      TDS Meter:
    
               Input Voltage: DC 3.3 ~ 5.5V
               Output Voltage: 0 ~ 2.3V
               Working Current: 3 ~ 6mA
               TDS Measurement Range: 0 ~ 1000ppm
               TDS Measurement Accuracy: ± 10% F.S. (25 ℃)
               Module Interface: XH2.54-3P
               Electrode Interface: XH2.54-2P

      TDS Probe: 
             
               Number of Needle: 2
               Total Length: 60cm
               Connection Interface: XH2.54-2P
               Color: White

                compensationCoefficient = 1.0+0.02*(temperature-25.0)
                  
                compensationVoltage=averageVoltage/compensationCoefficient  

                tdsValue=(133.42*compensationVoltage*compensationVoltage*compensationVoltage - 255.86*compensationVoltage*compensationVoltage + 857.39*compensationVoltage)*0.5
